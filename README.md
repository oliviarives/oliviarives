- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @oliviarives
- ğŸ‘€ My interest in IT covers a wide range of areas. I'm deeply involved in front-end web development, where I create intuitive and responsive user interfaces that
- facilitate interaction with the web application. At the same time, my interest in back-end development leads me to explore the behind-the-scenes aspects of web applications.
- Server management, API programming and database interaction are all aspects that I strive to master.
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning corporate network administration, which includes network hardware configuration, maintenance, installation and reset.
